==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been 
video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 
70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in 
fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which 
has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration 
and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz 
cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time 
and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all variables.

- 'Tidy_data.txt': Tidy data set containing the features' means and standard deviations averaged for each subject and each activity.

- 'run_analysis.R': Performs the steps to achieve a tidy data set.


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. "subjectID" contains integers 1-30. 
  "activity" has six levels representing the six activities described above.
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.


Steps of analysis: 
==================
- Combine test and train data as well as subject IDs, activities and features to one data set.
- Extract only features which contain either a mean or a standard deviation. 
- Create descriptive variable names. 
- Replace activity numbers with names. 
- Create the average for each feature by subject and activity. 
- Save the new data set.
